normally purpose of this application is calculating and/or asking value of check through (if possible) online system before it expires

what can i do with this

- android branch is for android application, created with intellij idea 2014 then upgraded to 2016 but untested with new version

- gh-pages is also available, it is just plain html page and some js functions to calculate stuff

- maybe localstorage can be added in future to make sure webapp is capable of saving stuff (userly things)
